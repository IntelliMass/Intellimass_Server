But after the Android 10 update on the Google pixel 2 xl, I'm not able to chat with other contacts while I'm on video call with picture to picture mode like before. Emailed support and it's like they didn't even try to understand what the problem was and just replied with random links resolutions. Not sure if it was Android update issue or what. Still have the issue."

# rev2 = "This would be a much better app if it wasn't such a pain in the arse to update contacts. How hard does it have to be? *Edit*. A year on, and still a pain. Trying to get a contact who is on WhatsApp into the contact list just doesn't happen. You can refresh until you're blye in the face. It still wont add them."

Please add this feature it would be very helpfull"
